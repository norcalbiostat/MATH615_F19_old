# Who are we learning it with? 

My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can address me as "Robin", "Dr. D", or some other respectful title such as "professor". 

I have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA, but I'm a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics &  Biology, with minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at Butte College. 

My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.

When I’m not on campus, typically I’m growing food for my family, out adventuring with my dogs, or getting some game time in.

You can learn more about the work that I do on my [website](http://www.norcalbiostat.com/)


# How are we gonna learn it? (Required materials)
Homework 0 gets you connected with these materials. 

* **Textbook**: _Practical Multivariate Analysis, 6th ed_ by Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark. [[Link]](https://www.routledge.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis/Afifi-May-Donatello-Clark/p/book/9781032088471)
    - This wil be used in Math 456, and is an excellent reference guide.
    - If you're curious, I get about 1% of the sale in royalty. The income is *not* why I collaborated on this edition. I used the 4th edition in grad school and really like teaching out of it. 
    - _Optional_: Open Intro Statistics 3rd edition. If you need a refresher on your basic statistics. Free PDF available at https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os
* **Reliable Laptop**: Expect to bring often. Contact me if this poses a problem or concern for you. 
* **Reliable internet** connection while on and off campus. ITSS can help you get this setup. 
* **Computer Software:** Data Analysis is done using statistical analysis software. Common statistical programs include SAS, STATA, R and SPSS. I am fluent in SAS, STATA and R, reasonably read in SPSS but can provide limited support for Python. The choice of software you use for this class is up to you, but you will be expected to learn how to navigate the programs outside of class time. 
    - I highly recommend making a habit to attend [Community Coding](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml)
* **Accounts:** 
    - **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1oeVbt6QXvNjiadAu8VspPLXOlfaMmtXP)**: You will be added to the Math 615 Google drive using your campus email.
    - **[Discord](https://discord.gg/tzcB4MJadW):** A free discussion platform with a lot of collaborative functionality. This is the defacto method of communication for the class. 
    - **[Hack MD]():** for collaborative notes. An account is needed to keep our notes private. I suggest you sign up with your campus email (@csuchico.edu)
    - **[Poll Everywhere](https://pollev.com/drd):** Used for frequent checks of your understanding of the current topic. You can respond on the web or via mobile app.

# Class Policies and statements

## Everyone is welcome here

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

-  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. 
        - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name. 
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
-   If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email [diversityoffice\@csuchico.edu](mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu){.email}
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

*Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)*.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.


## Attendance

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive. 

* If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms **DO NOT COME TO CLASS**. DM me in Discord we'll make a backup plan.

# University Policies

## COVID-19 

The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 by February 28th, 2022, unless you have an approved exemption. While Chico State has relaxed its stance on mask mandates, for your and my health and safety I _request_ that everyone wear an appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth while in class. 

Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or mandate may result in disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion from the California State University system. 


## Adding and Dropping the course

You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures about add/drops, academic renewal, etc., found in the [CSU Chico University Catalog](http://www.csuchico.edu/catalog/). You should be aware of the new deadlines and penalties for adding and dropping classes.

## Confidentiality and Mandatory Reoprting

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a your instructor. I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030). Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: www.csuchico.edu/title-ix.


## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.
