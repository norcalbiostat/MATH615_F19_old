# Who are we learning it with? 

My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can address me as "Robin", "Dr. D", or some other respectful title such as "professor". 

I have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA, but I'm a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics &  Biology, with minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at Butte College. 

My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.

When I‚Äôm not on campus, typically I‚Äôm growing ü•ïüåæüçÖüçÜüçè for my family, out adventuring with my üê∂üßîüê©, or getting some üéÆüé≤üìö time in.

You can learn more about the work that I do on my [website](http://www.norcalbiostat.com/)


# How are we gonna learn it? (Required materials)
Homework 0 gets you connected with these materials. 

* **Textbook**: _Practical Multivariate Analysis, 6th ed_ by Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark. [[Link]](https://www.routledge.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis/Afifi-May-Donatello-Clark/p/book/9781032088471)
    - This wil be used in Math 456, and is an excellent reference guide.
    - If you're curious, I get about 1% of the sale in royalty. The income is *not* why I collaborated on this edition. I used the 4th edition in grad school and really like teaching out of it. 
    - _Optional_: Open Intro Statistics 3rd edition. If you need a refresher on your basic statistics. Free PDF available at https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os
* **Reliable Laptop**: Expect to bring often. Contact me if this poses a problem or concern for you. 
* **Reliable internet** connection while on and off campus. ITSS can help you get this setup. 
* **Computer Software:** Data Analysis is done using statistical analysis software. Common statistical programs include SAS, STATA, R and SPSS. I am fluent in SAS, STATA and R, but can provide limited support for SPSS and Python. The choice of software you use for this class is up to you, but you will be expected to learn how to navigate the programs outside of class time. 
* **Accounts:** Google Drive (campus account), Discord, for discussion. Hack MD for collaborative notes.

# How is learning measured? (What are you graded on?)

* Your final grade will be a straight sum of points earned and will be displayed as a running total in Blackboard Learn. 
* The approximate contributions per category are:  
  - Participation 15%: Slack usage, Peer reviews  
  - Written Assignments 20%: Submitted in Google Drive, but graded using a visable rubric in Blackboard Learn.  
  - Weekly Quizzes 25%: Google Forms. This replaces a midterm exam.  
  - Final exam 20%: Take home 
  - Project related assignments 20%  
* I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90\%: A, 89-80\%: B, 79-70\%: C, 69-60\%. Plusses and minuses will be as displayed on Blackboard Learn. 

# Schedule of Topics

The general ordering of topics is:

* Data Collection and recording
* Preparing data for analysis
* Data Visualization
* Foundations for Inference:  probability distributions, point and interval estimation, Hypothesis Testing
* Inference comparing multiple samples (t-tests, ANOVA, $\chi^{2}$ tests)
* Study design, confounding, causation **(experimental design??? and pseudoreplication?)**
* Linear regression analysis (Simple and Multiple, Categorical predictors, variable selection)
* Logistic regression analysis
* Model building techniques and comparing model fit
* Special analysis topics - how to identify when linear regression models won't work.

# Class Policies and statements

## Everyone is welcome here

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

-  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. 
        - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name. 
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
-   If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email [diversityoffice\@csuchico.edu](mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu){.email}
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

*Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)*.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.


## Attendance

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive. 

* If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms **DO NOT COME TO CLASS**. DM me in Discord and attend online until you can return. 
* I will be taking daily attendance - this is more for my learning of names and to keep an eye out for students who may be struggling in class and deciding not to show up. 


----

## Collaboration

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts with. Collaboration on individual quizzes is not allowed.

According to [this document about ollaboration](https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/_assets/documents/collaboration.pdf) linked on the CSU, Chico website: 

> Collaboration is working with another or receiving assistance from someone (e.g., a classmate, friend, or parent, whether in person or by electronic media) to complete coursework for a grade. 
> "Unauthorized collaboration" means working with others without the specific permission of the instructor on assignments that will be submitted for a grade. (i.e. in class or take home tests, quizzes, labs and homework)


Below are two quotes from [this article](https://revoteaching.blogspot.com/2021/04/ungrading-and-academic-integrity.html) that resonated with me. We will specifically talk about the idea of why students cheat in the first few weeks as a class. 

> "In my opinion students cheat for one of three reasons (or some combination): students don‚Äôt see the value in doing the work, or they don‚Äôt believe they can achieve that value if they do the work required of them, or they don‚Äôt know how to complete the work. Students cheat because they see the work as busy work, work that has no value. My students aren‚Äôt lazy. They have jobs in addition to school, they have family obligations, they have financial concerns that sometimes include housing and food insecurity. They also binge watch entertainment and play video games for hours on end. They have the ability to pay attention when their circumstances and their interests allow it."
> 
> "The solution to cheating is to address the motivation to cheat, not the consequences of cheating. Why would students cheat if they believed in the value (benefit) of the work, believed the work would produce the benefit, and believed they could complete the work? Our job as faculty is convince students of the first two ideas and help them with the third. And then we trust students to act in their own self-interest."
