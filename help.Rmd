### What am I graded on?

I care both that you are keeping up with the material, but also that by the end of the term you can conduct your own personalized analysis on a new data set. Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the semester

* Weekly quizzes on the prior week's content. (are you ready to move on?)
* Regular homework. This is your testing ground, your first round of practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set.
* Project. Can you weave together data and story to do research? 
* Final Exam. Can you analyze a new data set to answer a research question and write a professional report on your results? 


### How can you submit Anonymous feedback? 
I want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of appropriate uses of this feedback form. 

1) Class activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?
2) Topics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in class, but don't want to be the one to bring it up?
3) Flagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity. Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather than saving it for the course evaluation months later.
4) Words of Encouragement. I need positive feedback to keep me recharged!

### Technology

-   [IT Support Services](https://www.csuchico.edu/itss/) will provide comprehensive technology support, including laptop loans and virtual technology assistance.
-   The [Office of Accessible Technology Services](https://www.csuchico.edu/oats/) will offer all students online access to a staff member during normal business hours Monday--Friday via email at [oats@csuchico.edu](mailto:oats@csuchico.edu). Students with questions on inclusive technology or who need assistance setting up technology accommodations are encouraged to reach out.
-   If you do not have off-campus access to the Internet, [resources are available](https://www.csuchico.edu/coronavirus/internet.shtml).


## Quizzes

Quizzes are a great way to test yourself, enhance recall, and self-assess your comprehension of the subject. Quizzes are administered in Google Forms, and done in two parts.

1. **Individual**: First try to answer as many questions without looking at your notes. Then use your notes to answer the rest. 

2. **Group**: After the individual quiz closes I will choose 1-4 questions that the class as a whole seemed to struggle with the most. The next class period we will do a class-wide discussion of those topics, then you will work in groups to redo the selected questions. 

Points earned from the group quiz get added to your individual quiz score (not to exceed total points). 


## Assignments

### How do I complete the assignments? 

Most homework assignments will come with a template to use. This will be a R markdown (`*.Rmd`) file for R users, and a Word document (`*.doc`) for SPSS users. 

R users write their code and answers directly into the Rmd file. SPSS users will copy their code and relevant output into the Word doc, along with writing their answers in the Word doc directly. 

All homework files must be compiled or converted to PDF before submission. R users `knit` their file to PDF, SPSS users will `save as` their Word document as PDF. 

Links to the templates can be found in the homework assignment itself. A list of all assignment files can be found on the [materials](materials.html) page. 
    
### How/where do I submit completed assignments? 

**Standard Assignments**

* All assignments should be in PDF format. 
* The file should be clearly named using this format: `assignment_userid.pdf`. E.g. `univ_graphics_rdonatello.pdf`
* Uploaded to the corresponding assignment folder in Google Drive. 
* Assignments will be subject to peer review/comments
* Standard homework assignments just get checked off for completion. 
  - I will still review and comment on each assignment, writing corrections and suggestions for improvement on the PDF itself. 
* Once graded the file will be moved into the `graded` subfolder in Google Drive. 
* Grades are recorded in Blackboard learn. 

**Project Assignments**

* These assignments will be completed in Google Drive directly and will be peer reviewed. 
* On the due date for my review, you need to submit the URL through the Blackboard assignment. This allows me to use a rubric for grading in addition to providing specific feedback on the document itself. 
* Project assignments should be considered quality work and such refined, reviewed, and absolutely spellchecked before submission. 


### What are you looking for when you grade? 

* Most assignments include examples directly in the assignment file itself. 
* Correct English grammer, spelling, formatting. 
* Concise, clear and complete answers. 
* Correct statistical methods used
* That you answered the question posed. 
* No extraneous output or code

## Peer Review

### Why do we do peer review? 

* Everyone has different thought processes and may have approached the question from a different perspective that can help you learn the material. 
* Co-authoring and reviewing your peers work is part of a professional research position. 
* Learning how to provide good feedback will make you a better collaborator
* This is a delayed version of paired programming - another set of eyeballs can typically help you find your mistake. 
* I have 10fold more assignments to review than you do. 
    - You'll get your peer's reviews back faster than I can get yours back.
    - The more eyes on your document the better. 
* I will be looking for different things than your peers will be. This is a good thing. They are looking from "untrained eyes", which can be very critical to make sure you are explaining yourself clearly. I can better "figure out" what you are meaning to say  - they are the ones that will best tell you when/where you need to explain your findings better. 


### How do I conduct a Peer Review

1. Check the [Peer Review Rotation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16aT7O6A7fylqhE-OLpIp7cwpaQLKULrxT-D6yxQC15M/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet to see who you are scheduled to review. 
    - If one of your reviewees did not submit the assignment then pick another person to review. 
2. Open the assignment file in Google Drive directly. 
3. Change from "editing" to "suggesting" in the top right. 
4. By editing the verbiage directly, or using comment bubbles, provide feedback to your peers. 
    - Be specific. Give the type of feedback that you want to receive. 
    - Minimum three corrections or suggestions for improvement. If it is reworking/grammar make these edits directly in the document.  


### Grading of peer reviews

As I do my reviews on the same document, I will be reading and assessing your peer review. If I find your review is not providing quality feedback to the author you will not receive credit for that review. You may see the cells in the peer review spreadsheet changing color as I check off your review.  



## Life 

This is not an all encompassing list. If there is something not listed that you think should be, please let me know!

### Basic Needs

## Policies


### Everyone is welcome here

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

* Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. 
    - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name. 
* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
* If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email [diversityoffice\@csuchico.edu](mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu){.email}
* I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

*Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)*.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.


### Late work
* You should strive to submit on time for all draft items the sake of your peers. Do you want your reviews back in a timely manner? You should show them the same courtesy and professionalism. 
* I don't penalize for late work, but I prioritize on time submissions. If you submit an assignment after i'm done grading everyone elses, and we're moving on to the next topic then your assignment may have to wait a few days before I can get back to it. 

### Collaboration

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts with. Collaboration on individual quizzes is not allowed.


### Grading
See the [syllabus](syllabus.html). 

### COVID-19 

The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 by February 28th, 2022, unless you have an approved exemption. While Chico State has relaxed its stance on mask mandates, for your and my health and safety I _request_ that everyone wear an appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth while in class. 

Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or mandate may result in disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion from the California State University system. 

### Adding and Dropping the course

You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures about add/drops, academic renewal, etc., found in the [CSU Chico University Catalog](http://www.csuchico.edu/catalog/). You should be aware of the new deadlines and penalties for adding and dropping classes.


### Confidentiality and Mandatory Reoprting

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a your instructor. I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030). Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: www.csuchico.edu/title-ix.


### Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.
