# What is this course about

* Developing the skills to conduct statistically valid and reproducible research. 
* Understanding how data needs to be structured and formatted for analysis, so you can better prepare data collection methods for future research. 
* Becoming a critical consumer of the data being thrown at you. Sifting through the BS to understand the truth. 
* Practing the skills to be the boss of your own data without relying on others to "run the numbers" for you. 
* Learning basic statistical techniques for a small selection of analysis situations. 
* Laying the statistical foundation so you can learn to apply more advanced statistical models as needed, such as those covered in Applied Statisitcs II (Math 456).

# Project

* This course will revolve around a data analysis project. 
* Individual projects, but you will collaborate with each other through a peer review process. 
* All assignments are desgined to support your research.
* Must choose a project out of select data sets.
    - Individual research is typically not developed or robust enough to be demonstrative. 
* Project will culminate with the creation and presentation of a research poster. 
* More details are on the [project](project.html) page. 

# Computing and Reproducibility

* No more TI-83, modern statistics is computational based. And I don't mean Excel. 
* Big push for open research in the Natural and Social Sciences. 
    - Sharing code & data. Sometimes required along with manuscript for publishing. 
* Reproducibility. Give someone else access to your data and code, and they can replicate your findings. 
    - We will practice this in this class. 
    - I practice this by putting all class material online with a cc-by license. (others are free to copy and share my work with acknowledgement)
* Review these [Slides](http://benmarwick.github.io/UW-eScience-reproducibility-social-sciences/#/) on reproducible research in the social sciences.
    - I will not require any measure of version control or open source coding in this class. 
* Be mindful about file naming conventions (slide 11). Make a plan and stick with it. 
    * https://www.xkcd.com/1459/
* Expect to bring your laptop every day to class. 
    - The more reading and content learning done outside of class, the more time for in class analysis and discussion
    

# Software program of choice (SPC)   
* This class is not a class on how to use the software program. You will be responsible for learning a lot of the programming language outside of class on your own time. That's part of the process of a Masters program. You are learning how to learn, how to look stuff up, how to do new things. You can't learn all the things in 2 years. 
* All my lecture notes use R. This entire website is built with R. R is a pioneer in generating reproducible and publishable quality reports. 
    - [Here's an student-generated example](../reading/Final_chem_report.pdf)
* I will not dictate which software program you use in this class. 
* But I will expect you to submit reproducible code. You can point and click your way to an answer, but code must be saved and reusible with minimal changes. 
* Be open to new things, there is power in being polyglottal. You can use one language in here and another language for another class or project. 
* Your professors in your other classes, or your masters committee may want you to learn a specific language. That should influence your choice. 
    - So should your industry. Don't make assumptions, look at job postings and see what they want. 
    - I.e. Center for Healthy Communities has a lot of Nutrition faculty/students. They're moving towards R. 
    - Political Science & Economics often use Stata. I've met Sociologists that use SAS, Stata, R and SPSS. 


## SPSS
* Purchase v25 or v26 from http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/spss-stats-gradpack for $50 for 6mo rental. 
* Point and click, but can save code and write scripts. 
* Stand alone program. No integration. Licenses are not cheap. 
* Will be used again in NSFC 600 (no exp necc for that class either)
* On campus resources: From the desk of David Philhour (BSS) 
    - Open computer labs in Butte Hall (207, 211) with many open lab hours.
    - Tutoring center in AJH108 run by Dr. Penelope Kuhn. 
    - Check availability of Psyc dept lab in Modoc 224

## R 
* Free. Installation Instructions available in `lec02` from my Math 130 webpage: https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/
* Harder up front, more powerful in the end. 
* Seamless integration with a multitude of other scientific analysis and reproducible reporting mechanisms. 
* Becoming much more popular in all scientific fields of study. One of the primary languages for Data Science. 
* Google at [diagram](https://osf.io/69gub/wiki/home/) of the `tidyverse` (a suite of functions in R). Compare it to the images of the data analysis life cycle. What sense do you get? 
* Need some motivation?

## SAS? STATA? Python? 
Yes, yes and yes. You can use any software program you want. 

* SAS has only now working on literate and integrated programming by using Jupyter notebooks and SAS University Edition (free)
* Stata has a few user written packages that allow for the integration of LaTeX or markdown into your code document. 
* Python is the other primary language for Data Science. 


# Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**.

You need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are: 

* ALL CAPS (MATH615)
* no caps (math615)
* snake_case (math_615) 
* CamelCase (Math615) 

Call this working directory `math615`, and create the four subfolders: `data`, `scripts`, `documents` and `project`.  

You will put all files related to this class in here. For example lecture notes and the sylalbus go in the `documents` folder, homework code files in the `scripts` folder, data and codebook in, you guessed it, the `data` folder, and code specifically for your project in the `project` folder. 

This means when you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file. Do not let files live in your downloads folder. 


Your working directory should now look similar to this:
