# What is this course about

* Developing the skills to conduct statistically valid and reproducible research. 
* Understanding how data needs to be structured and formatted for analysis, so you can better prepare data collection methods for future research. 
* Becoming a critical consumer of the data being thrown at you. Sifting through the BS to understand the truth. 
* Practing the skills to be the boss of your own data without relying on others to "run the numbers" for you. 
* Learning basic statistical techniques for a small selection of analysis situations. 
* Laying the statistical foundation so you can learn to apply more advanced statistical models as needed, such as those covered in Applied Statisitcs II (Math 456). 


# Course resources

* **Class Website**
    * https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/ 
        - Landing page for announcements
        - Details on weekly topics can be found on the schedule
        - Includes links to notes, assignments and additional materials
    * Often links will be broken. Typo's happen. Notify me via slack and I'll get to it asap. 
    * The syllabus covers course details such as grading, office location and classroom policies. 

* **Blackboard Learn (BBL)** is used for recording grades via grading rubric. 

* **Google Drive**
    -- Assignments will be turned in and peer reviewed through Google Drive. 
    
* **Textbook: Practical Multivariable Analysis (PMA5 / PMA6)**
    - The textbook is used for data, reading and learning content. 
        - Great long term resource
        - New edition coming out in October (ish). You can get the 5th or wait for the 6th edition. 
        - I've provided a draft for select chapters in the 6th edition. 
        
* **Slack** will be used for outside class discussions, homework help and general chatter. 
    - I will not answer most questions through email. 
    - Download either the phone app or the desktop app (I use both). This is mandatory.
      Do not rely on remembering to log in via the web browser. You will miss important notifications. 
    
    
* **Lecture notes**
    - Combination of the Applied Statistics notebook, and stand alone lecture notes like these. 
    - Most are available as PDF or HTML. 

# Project

* This course will revolve around a data analysis project. 
* Individual projects, but you will collaborate with each other through a peer review process. 
* All assignments are desgined to support your research.
* Must choose a project out of select data sets.
    - Individual research is typically not developed or robust enough to be demonstrative. 
* Project will culminate with the creation and presentation of a research poster. 
* More details are on the [project](project.html) page. 

# Computing and Reproducibility

* No more TI-83, modern statistics is computational based. And I don't mean Excel. 
* Big push for open research in the Natural and Social Sciences. 
    - Sharing code & data. Sometimes required along with manuscript for publishing. 
* Reproducibility. Give someone else access to your data and code, and they can replicate your findings. 
    - We will practice this in this class. 
    - I practice this by putting all class material online with a cc-by license. (others are free to copy and share my work with acknowledgement)
* Review these [Slides](http://benmarwick.github.io/UW-eScience-reproducibility-social-sciences/#/) on reproducible research in the social sciences.
    - I will not require any measure of version control or open source coding in this class. 
* Be mindful about file naming conventions (slide 11). Make a plan and stick with it. 
    * https://www.xkcd.com/1459/
* Expect to bring your laptop every day to class. 
    - The more reading and content learning done outside of class, the more time for in class analysis and discussion
    

# Software program of choice (SPC)   
* This class is not a class on how to use the software program. You will be responsible for learning a lot of the programming language outside of class on your own time. That's part of the process of a Masters program. You are learning how to learn, how to look stuff up, how to do new things. You can't learn all the things in 2 years. 
* All my lecture notes use R. This entire website is built with R. R is a pioneer in generating reproducible and publishable quality reports. 
    - [Here's an student-generated example](../reading/Final_chem_report.pdf)
* I will not dictate which software program you use in this class. 
* But I will expect you to submit reproducible code. You can point and click your way to an answer, but code must be saved and reusible with minimal changes. 
* Be open to new things, there is power in being polyglottal. You can use one language in here and another language for another class or project. 
* Your professors in your other classes, or your masters committee may want you to learn a specific language. That should influence your choice. 
    - So should your industry. Don't make assumptions, look at job postings and see what they want. 
    - I.e. Center for Healthy Communities has a lot of Nutrition faculty/students. They're moving towards R. 
    - Political Science & Economics often use Stata. I've met Sociologists that use SAS, Stata, R and SPSS. 


## SPSS
* Purchase v25 or v26 from http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/spss-stats-gradpack for $50 for 6mo rental. 
* Point and click, but can save code and write scripts. 
* Stand alone program. No integration. Licenses are not cheap. 
* Will be used again in NSFC 600 (no exp necc for that class either)
* On campus resources: From the desk of David Philhour (BSS) 
    - Open computer labs in Butte Hall (207, 211) with many open lab hours.
    - Tutoring center in AJH108 run by Dr. Penelope Kuhn. 
    - Check availability of Psyc dept lab in Modoc 224
* Off Campus resources
    - Kent State University Tutorials: https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/home

## R 
* Free. Installation Instructions available in `lec02` from my Math 130 webpage: https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/
* Harder up front, more powerful in the end. 
* Seamless integration with a multitude of other scientific analysis and reproducible reporting mechanisms. 
* Becoming much more popular in all scientific fields of study. One of the primary languages for Data Science. 
* Google at [diagram](https://osf.io/69gub/wiki/home/) of the `tidyverse` (a suite of functions in R). Compare it to the images of the data analysis life cycle. What sense do you get? 
* Need some motivation?

## SAS? STATA? Python? 
Yes, yes and yes. You can use any software program you want. 

* SAS has only now working on literate and integrated programming by using Jupyter notebooks and SAS University Edition (free)
* Stata has a few user written packages that allow for the integration of LaTeX or markdown into your code document. 
* Python is the other primary language for Data Science. 


# Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**.

You need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are: 

* ALL CAPS (MATH615)
* no caps (math615)
* snake_case (math_615) 
* CamelCase (Math615) 

Call this working directory `math615`, and create the four subfolders: `data`, `scripts`, `documents` and `project`.  

You will put all files related to this class in here. For example lecture notes and the sylalbus go in the `documents` folder, homework code files in the `scripts` folder, data and codebook in, you guessed it, the `data` folder, and code specifically for your project in the `project` folder. 

This means when you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file. Do not let files live in your downloads folder. 


Your working directory should now look similar to this:
