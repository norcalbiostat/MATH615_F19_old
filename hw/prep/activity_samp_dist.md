# In class activity -- Discovering Sampling Distributions. 

In this activity you will be creating random samples to simulate a probability density distribution. We will create distributions of data (x), and see how they differ from the distribution of the average ($\bar{x}$). 

## Setup

* Each group assigns one person to be a recorder, another to be a plotter. 
* Write the number of people in your group in front of the die size in the top right. 
      - E.g. if there are *3* of you and you are using a *D4*, your group would be *3d4*
* Everyone gets a die to roll. 
* The recorder logs into Google drive and opens the designated spreadsheet and identifies the group they are working in. 

## Phase 1: Create a random sample of $x$'s

* Everyone rolls their dice and report the values to the recorder and the plotter. 
* The recorder enters the data into their assigned column.
* The plotter draws a dot above the value on the x-axis on the top graph. Stack the dots for repeated rolls vertically. 
* Collect as much data as you can in 5 minutes. 
* Describe the distribution of the xâ€™s in the [[Hack MD Lec05 notes]](https://hackmd.io/@norcalbiostat/math615_lec05). Discuss location, shape, spread. 

## Phase 2: Create a random sample of $\bar{x}$'s. 

* Pick a different person to be the plotter and recorder. 
* Everyone rolls their die at the same time and report the values to the recorder
* The recorder enters the raw data points into the colored cells (x). The mean will automatically be calculated and displayed in the gray box. 
* The recorder then records the calculated average in the xbar column and tells this number to the plotter, who plots this data point as a dot on the bottom graph. 
* Collect as much data as you can in 10 minutes. 
* Describe the distribution of the $\bar{x}$'s in the [[Hack MD Lec05 notes]](https://hackmd.io/@norcalbiostat/math615_lec05). Discuss location, shape, spread. 


## Wrap up
* Take a picture of your plot. 
* Upload to the `07 Foundatinos for Inference/Simulation` folder in Google Drive. 
* Name this file with your 'group' name (e.g. `3d4`)
