<h1>Who are we learning it with?</h1>
<p>My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can
address me as “Robin”, “Dr. D”, or some other respectful title such as
“professor”.</p>
<p>I have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA,
but I’m a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics &amp; Biology, with
minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started
at Butte College.</p>
<p>My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists
how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and
ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through
intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative
(DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing
analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and
off campus.</p>
<p>When I’m not on campus, typically I’m growing 🥕🌾🍅🍆🍏 for my
family, out adventuring with my 🐶🧔🐩, or getting some 🎮🎲📚 time
in.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the work that I do on my <a

<li><strong>Textbook</strong>: <em>Practical Multivariate Analysis, 6th
ed</em> by Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark. <a
href="https://www.routledge.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis/Afifi-May-Donatello-Clark/p/book/9781032088471">[Link]</a>
<ul>
<li>This wil be used in Math 456, and is an excellent reference
guide.</li>
<li>If you’re curious, I get about 1% of the sale in royalty. The income
is <em>not</em> why I collaborated on this edition. I used the 4th
edition in grad school and really like teaching out of it.</li>
<li><em>Optional</em>: Open Intro Statistics 3rd edition. If you need a
refresher on your basic statistics. Free PDF available at <a

if this poses a problem or concern for you.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable internet</strong> connection while on and off
campus. ITSS can help you get this setup.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Software:</strong> Data Analysis is done using
statistical analysis software. Common statistical programs include SAS,
STATA, R and SPSS. I am fluent in SAS, STATA and R, but can provide
limited support for SPSS and Python. The choice of software you use for
this class is up to you, but you will be expected to learn how to

</li>
<li>Written Assignments 20%: Submitted in Google Drive, but graded using
a visable rubric in Blackboard Learn.<br />
</li>
<li>Weekly Quizzes 25%: Google Forms. This replaces a midterm
exam.<br />
</li>
<li>Final exam 20%: Take home</li>

<h1>Class Policies and statements</h1>
<div id="everyone-is-welcome-here" class="section level2">
<h2>Everyone is welcome here</h2>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>I would like to create a learning environment that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability,
etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ
from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point
to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately
as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to
honor your name.</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and
talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule
and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general
announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the
Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu"
class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
(Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica
Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to
miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason,
PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms
<strong>DO NOT COME TO CLASS</strong>. DM me in Discord and attend
online until you can return.</li>
<li>I will be taking daily attendance - this is more for my learning of
names and to keep an eye out for students who may be struggling in class
and deciding not to show up.</li>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with. Collaboration on
individual quizzes is not allowed.</p>
<p>According to <a
href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/_assets/documents/collaboration.pdf">this
document about ollaboration</a> linked on the CSU, Chico website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collaboration is working with another or receiving assistance from
someone (e.g., a classmate, friend, or parent, whether in person or by
electronic media) to complete coursework for a grade. “Unauthorized
collaboration” means working with others without the specific permission
of the instructor on assignments that will be submitted for a grade.
(i.e. in class or take home tests, quizzes, labs and homework)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below are two quotes from <a
href="https://revoteaching.blogspot.com/2021/04/ungrading-and-academic-integrity.html">this
article</a> that resonated with me. We will specifically talk about the
idea of why students cheat in the first few weeks as a class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In my opinion students cheat for one of three reasons (or some
combination): students don’t see the value in doing the work, or they
don’t believe they can achieve that value if they do the work required
of them, or they don’t know how to complete the work. Students cheat
because they see the work as busy work, work that has no value. My
students aren’t lazy. They have jobs in addition to school, they have
family obligations, they have financial concerns that sometimes include
housing and food insecurity. They also binge watch entertainment and
play video games for hours on end. They have the ability to pay
attention when their circumstances and their interests allow it.”</p>
<p>“The solution to cheating is to address the motivation to cheat, not
the consequences of cheating. Why would students cheat if they believed
in the value (benefit) of the work, believed the work would produce the
benefit, and believed they could complete the work? Our job as faculty
is convince students of the first two ideas and help them with the
third. And then we trust students to act in their own
self-interest.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of

respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of
behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action.
Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or
plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a
href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml"
class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you
have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of
violating academic integrity.</p>
