<p>I care both that you are keeping up with the material, but also that
by the end of the term you can conduct your own personalized analysis on
a new data set. Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the
semester</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly quizzes on the prior week’s content. (are you ready to move
on?)</li>
<li>Regular homework. This is your testing ground, your first round of
practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set.</li>
<li>Project. Can you weave together data and story to do research?</li>
<li>Final Exam. Can you analyze a new data set to answer a research
question and write a professional report on your results?</li>

<h3>How can you submit Anonymous feedback?</h3>
<p>I want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for
everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do
not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of
appropriate uses of this feedback form.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Class activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep
doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?</li>
<li>Topics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in
class, but don’t want to be the one to bring it up?</li>
<li>Flagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and
microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity.
Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created
discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather
than saving it for the course evaluation months later.</li>
<li>Words of Encouragement. I need positive feedback to keep me
recharged!</li>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<h3>How do I complete the assignments?</h3>
<p>Most homework assignments will come with a template to use. This will
be a R markdown (<code>*.Rmd</code>) file for R users, and a Word
document (<code>*.doc</code>) for SPSS users.</p>
<p>R users write their code and answers directly into the Rmd file. SPSS
users will copy their code and relevant output into the Word doc, along
with writing their answers in the Word doc directly.</p>
<p>All homework files must be compiled or converted to PDF before
submission. R users <code>knit</code> their file to PDF, SPSS users will
<code>save as</code> their Word document as PDF.</p>
<p>Links to the templates can be found in the homework assignment
itself. A list of all assignment files can be found on the <a

<div id="howwhere-do-i-submit-completed-assignments"
class="section level3">
<h3>How/where do I submit completed assignments?</h3>
<p><strong>Standard Assignments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All assignments should be in PDF format.</li>
<li>The file should be clearly named using this format:
<code>assignment_userid.pdf</code>. E.g.
<code>univ_graphics_rdonatello.pdf</code></li>
<li>Uploaded to the corresponding assignment folder in Google
Drive.</li>
<li>Assignments will be subject to peer review/comments</li>
<li>Standard homework assignments just get checked off for completion.
<ul>
<li>I will still review and comment on each assignment, writing
corrections and suggestions for improvement on the PDF itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once graded the file will be moved into the <code>graded</code>
subfolder in Google Drive.</li>
<li>Grades are recorded in Blackboard learn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Assignments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These assignments will be completed in Google Drive directly and
will be peer reviewed.</li>
<li>On the due date for my review, you need to submit the URL through
the Blackboard assignment. This allows me to use a rubric for grading in
addition to providing specific feedback on the document itself.</li>
<li>Project assignments should be considered quality work and such
refined, reviewed, and absolutely spellchecked before submission.</li>

<h2>Peer Review</h2>
<div id="why-do-we-do-peer-review" class="section level3">
<h3>Why do we do peer review?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everyone has different thought processes and may have approached the
question from a different perspective that can help you learn the
material.</li>
<li>Co-authoring and reviewing your peers work is part of a professional
research position.</li>
<li>Learning how to provide good feedback will make you a better
collaborator</li>
<li>This is a delayed version of paired programming - another set of
eyeballs can typically help you find your mistake.</li>
<li>I have 10fold more assignments to review than you do.
<ul>
<li>You’ll get your peer’s reviews back faster than I can get yours
back.</li>
<li>The more eyes on your document the better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will be looking for different things than your peers will be. This
is a good thing. They are looking from “untrained eyes”, which can be
very critical to make sure you are explaining yourself clearly. I can
better “figure out” what you are meaning to say - they are the ones that
will best tell you when/where you need to explain your findings
better.</li>

<ul>
<li>If one of your reviewees did not submit the assignment then pick
another person to review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open the assignment file in Google Drive directly.</li>
<li>Change from “editing” to “suggesting” in the top right.</li>
<li>By editing the verbiage directly, or using comment bubbles, provide
feedback to your peers.
<ul>
<li>Be specific. Give the type of feedback that you want to
receive.</li>
<li>Minimum three corrections or suggestions for improvement. If it is
reworking/grammar make these edits directly in the document.</li>

<h3>Grading of peer reviews</h3>
<p>As I do my reviews on the same document, I will be reading and

<h2>Policies</h2>
<div id="everyone-is-welcome-here" class="section level3">
<h3>Everyone is welcome here</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>I would like to create a learning environment that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability,
etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ
from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point
to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
to be called.
<ul>
<li>I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible.
The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your
name.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and
talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule
and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general
announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the
Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu"
class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
(Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica
Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Late work</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should strive to submit on time for all draft items the sake of
your peers. Do you want your reviews back in a timely manner? You should
show them the same courtesy and professionalism.</li>
<li>I don’t penalize for late work, but I prioritize on time
submissions. If you submit an assignment after i’m done grading everyone
elses, and we’re moving on to the next topic then your assignment may
have to wait a few days before I can get back to it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="collaboration" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with. Collaboration on
individual quizzes is not allowed.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>

<div id="covid-19" class="section level3">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against
COVID-19 by February 28th, 2022, unless you have an approved exemption.
While Chico State has relaxed its stance on mask mandates, for your and
my health and safety I <em>request</em> that everyone wear an
appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth while in class.</p>
<p>Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or
your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or
mandate may result in disciplinary action against you through the office
of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include
suspension or expulsion from the California State University system.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-and-dropping-the-course" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding and Dropping the course</h3>
<p>You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures
about add/drops, academic renewal, etc., found in the <a
href="http://www.csuchico.edu/catalog/">CSU Chico University
Catalog</a>. You should be aware of the new deadlines and penalties for
adding and dropping classes.</p>

<div id="confidentiality-and-mandatory-reoprting"

<h3>Confidentiality and Mandatory Reoprting</h3>
<p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe
learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting
responsibility related to my role as a your instructor. I am required to
share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University.
Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the
Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030).
Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related
resources are available here: www.csuchico.edu/title-ix.</p>

<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of
adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness,
respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of
behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action.
Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or
plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a
href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml"
class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you
have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of
violating academic integrity.</p>
